## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- npm or yarn
- Expo CLI

### Installation

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AboubakreSenouci/FlixFlex.git
   cd FlixFlex
   ```

2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the app

   npx expo start
   ```

## Development Options

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a:

- [Development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a sandbox environment for quick testing

### Expo Router & File Structure

We implemented a file-based routing system using Expo Router with TypeScript (`.tsx` files). The structure includes:

- Authentication flow with protected routes
- Tab-based navigation for separating movies and series
- Dynamic routes for detailed content pages using parameters (`[id].tsx`)

This approach provides a clean separation of concerns and intuitive navigation.

### API Layer

We created a dedicated API directory to:

- Isolate external service calls
- Implement proper error handling
- Structure endpoints by domain (movies, series, authentication)
- Enable easy mocking for testing

### Firebase Integration

Firebase was selected for authentication because it:

- Provides secure, reliable user management
- Offers multiple login methods (email/password, social)
- Scales well with growing user bases
- Integrates with other Firebase services for future expansion

### The Movie Database API

We chose TMDB API (https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) for its:

- Extensive database of movies and TV shows
- High-quality imagery (posters, backdrops)
- Detailed metadata (cast, crew, ratings)
- Regular updates with new content
- Well-documented endpoints

### Data Management

React Query was implemented to:

- Handle loading and error states consistently
- Reduce unnecessary network requests

### AsyncStorage

Used for persisting:

- Recently viewed content
